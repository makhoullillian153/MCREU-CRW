# MCREU-Coalescing Random Walks
Within this repository you will find three different folders for the simulations written in Python (Bram Silbert) and R (Lillian Makhoul). There is also a third folder where the simulations were started to be translated to C, as C is more high performing that Python or R are, and would run the simulations much more quickly. This code was never finished, however the Python and R codes run without error.
